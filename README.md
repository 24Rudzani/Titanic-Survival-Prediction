# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning ( Random Forest ). The model analyses features like passenger class, age, gender, and fare to determine survival likelihood, achieving 83.8% accuracy.

🎯 Why I Built This Project
I built this project because I love turning raw data into meaningful stories. The Titanic dataset is perfect for this, it’s not just about predicting survival, but uncovering human stories hidden in the numbers. Here’s what excited me:

Real-world impact: This isn’t synthetic data, it’s about real people. I enjoyed asking questions like:
Why did gender and class play such huge roles in survival ?
How might feature engineering ( like FamilySize ) reveal hidden patterns ?

The thrill of problem solving: From handling messy data ( missing Age/Cabin values ) to optimizing model accuracy, every step felt like a puzzle.

Visual storytelling: Creating plots ( e.g., survival rates by class ) made the insights click, both for me and future viewers of this project.

🛠 Skills Demonstrated
✔ Data Wrangling: Turned messy data into actionable insights ( e.g., median Age imputation ).
✔ Exploratory Analysis (EDA): Used Seaborn/Matplotlib to reveal key trends ( e.g., "Women and children first" wasn’t just a movie trope! ).
✔ Machine Learning: Trained a Random Forest model ( 83.8% accuracy ) and interpreted feature importance.
✔ Critical Thinking: Asked "Why?" at every step (e.g., "Does Fare correlate with survival, or is it just a proxy for class?").

🔍 What I Learned
Data tells stories: The numbers confirmed historical biases (e.g., class privilege in survival rates).

Feature engineering is creative: Simple additions (like IsAlone) can boost model performance.

Models aren’t black boxes: By analyzing feature importance, I saw why the model made certain predictions.

Fun moment: Discovering that a passenger’s title (Mr./Mrs.) might be a stronger predictor than raw age—something to explore next time!
